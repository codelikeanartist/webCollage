Releases allow to store larger files:
If you need to distribute large files within your repository, we recommend that you create releases for your projects on GitHub. Releases allow you to include binary files, such as compiled programs. For more information, visit "Creating releases."
We don't limit the total size of your binary release files, nor the bandwidth used to deliver them. However, each individual file must be under 2 GB in size. (https://help.github.com/en/articles/distributing-large-binaries)
